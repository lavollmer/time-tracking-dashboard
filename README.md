## Overview

Challenge: A perfect opportunity to practice your CSS Grid skills. For anyone wanting to take it up a notch, we provide a JSON data file to practice working with data.

## What I learned

I reinforced and learned a lot of new things during this project. Some of things that were more relevant:

1. **_TailwindCSS Setup_** - I found that I had issues in the beginning with my TailwindCSS setup. Through the debugging process, I was able to learn that the plugins field in the tailwindcss config file needed to be an empty array. I had it with {} instead of []. The plugins field needs to hold a list of plugins that extends Tailwind's functionality.
2. **_Concurrently dev script_** - Concurrently is a command-line tool that allows multiple commands to run in a single terminal window. It allows the application to run multiple processes at the same time. 
3. **_Reusable Components_** - I worked a lot more on the reusable components aspect - trying to make one component that could be used for all the card sections. I was able to learn about passing down props for styling and using Typescript.
